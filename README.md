# Stendeback-Javascript-Quiz
This repository houses the source code used to create an interactive quiz using javascript! The quiz questions will include unique coding questions that would be useful for any full stack developer to know!

This project was my first implementing javascript, and I have to say it was a bit tougher than the previous projects! Being able to create functions and logic, and adding that to your HTML/CSS is complicated at first, and you definitely have to toy with the logic within your functions, as you will be able to see in this project, as I switched things around constantly to attempt at making them look better, and function better. I first used HTML and Bootstrap to get the foundational layout for the page itself, and then began adding javascript and minor CSS tweaks slowly, to polish the website and add interactivity. The hardest part of this project for me was bug fixing. Being able to scope out errors within your code, whether it works or not, is challenging. Making certain buttons visible before the quiz, and invisible during, was quite tough for me, but ultimately figured things out by constant changing and testing. I tried to make everything look unique while keeping the functionality needed for the acceptance criteria. 

One final note: The nav bar buttons were placed there as a reminder to myself to continue updating this project in the future, so I can potentially add it to my final portfolio that job employers will look at. It isn't required for this project, but just wanted to point that out in case you question why they aren't interactive just yet. Everything else looks and runs as it should! Thank you for looking through my project!
